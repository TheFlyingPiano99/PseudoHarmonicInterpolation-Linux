# Pseudo Harmonic Surface Generator

This C++ program generates 3D geometry in Wavefront OBJ format.
The generated surface is an approximation of harmonic surfaces.
The algorithm is based on a modified Gordon-Wixom interpolation scheme.

## Note

The code was tested on Ubuntu. The used triangulation library did not seem to work under MS Windows.
